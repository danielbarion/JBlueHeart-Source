Tomb of the Saintess:<br>

After seeing it... you have noticed the inscription:
<br>

Here lies the Holy Sopina who devoted his life to the kingdom Elmoreden and death - goddess Einhasad.
Yes, die in the thrones of death, turned away from the teachings of the saint, or trying to get her strength.
<br>

This is not Solina's real tomb.
