I checked the supply warehouse..<br>
The current level of delivery - <font color="LEVEL">%supplylvl%</font>. After concluding an alliance with the main lock can receive offers of supplies.<br>
At the time of the Union supply levels increased by 1 every 6 hours. There are 6 levels. But do not forget that before receiving the supplies you will need to pay 25,000 adena.<br>
