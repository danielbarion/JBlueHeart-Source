I'm very impressed.<br>
No one has ever broken through this fast to the Hall of Suffering. Extraordinary! In recognition of your achievement, I will give you a <font color="LEVEL">Jeweled Battle Supply</font>.<br>
It is granted only to those who achieve an especially impressive feat in battle.<br>
Your leader may receive it on your behalf.<br>
