If any custom feature made it to become what we call an "L2J Mod" and needed an extra table setup in order to work correctly, such a table definition/content should be available in this folder with an appropiate name.

Additionally, changes should be made in the database installation scripts in order to provide administrators with an option to dump these tables in their databases. People willing to contribute L2J mods should look at the wedding mod example for further details.
